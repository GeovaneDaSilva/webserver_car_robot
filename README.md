## CONNECTING ARDUINO WITH JAVASCRIPT AND NODE.JS - WEBSOCKETS


### You will need some components:
Enter this channel and follow the packages so you can buy all accessories.
My project is already set up, you can download and use it on your machine, but all content has been installed on the channel
ACROBOTIC.

It is worth remembering that my inspiration came from these guys that I sent.

Another channel that I highly recommend for you to follow on GitHub is this guy's channel here:
https://github.com/acrobotic/Ai_Demos_ESP8266/tree/master/webserver_rc_robot/data

He also made a cart and has a repository, he helped me a lot in setting up my cart, enjoy it, it could save your life !!!
This connection is connected with WebSockets

However, I had some incompatibilities and difficulties in following the video, referring to some technical problems, so I leave the project already updated for all of you!

Follow the steps to be able to configure the project:
Install Arduino on your machine.
You need to install the packages that are already in the project, just go to manager packages and install the necessary packages.

### Download the project and walk to the folder => img_products.
In it you will find all the photos of the products you will need to buy!
A hug and a lot of luck in your project.
